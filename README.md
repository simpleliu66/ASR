# Behavior Cloning-based Active Scene Recognition for Domestic Robots

This repository includes the demonstration videos of our proposed method called **Behavior Cloning-based Active Scene Recognition for Domestic Robots**. 

:hourglass_flowing_sand: We will publish the source code and data once the paper is accepted. 

:beer: Prior to this, we are more than happy to discuss the details of our algorithm if you are interested. Please feel free to contact us without any hesitation.

# Demonstration
## Some demos of scene recognition tasks in [**Habitat**](https://aihabitat.org/datasets/hm3d/).
The left window shows the robot's real-time observations, and the right window displays the process and result of active scene recognition.

## Using ASR during robot random exporation
When the scene recognition request (shown in the left top of the window) is **Yes** during the random exporation, the robot needs to recognize the scene using our method.
